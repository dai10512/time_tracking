Project Overview
This project is the final assignment for the Coursera course "hogehoge". It is a Flutter-based application developed to demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired during the course.

Tech Stack
State Management: The provider package is used for efficient state management throughout the application.
Data Persistence: User data is stored persistently using LocalStorage.
Learning Objectives
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing state management and data persistence in Flutter applications. The goal was to apply the concepts learned in the Coursera course and build a practical application.
